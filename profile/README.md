[The Scala Workshop](https://workshop.scala-lang.org), the spiritual successor of the Scala Symposium, focuses on the [Scala programming language](https://scala-lang.org), bringing together researchers and practitioners to discuss its design, implementation, and applications.
Topics include language features, tools, and libraries, as well as functional and object-oriented programming paradigms.
The workshop promotes collaboration between academia and industry to advance Scala's development and usage.
The audience includes researchers, developers, and industry professionals who work with Scala or related technologies.
